      Since the begining of this blog I'm sending a <strong>spam free</strong> newsletter.
      I mainly work with PHP, Docker, Javascript and SQL-NOSQL databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      By subscribing to newsletter you will get in your inbox my latest web
      development posts, at most once a week.
    </p>

      <strong> Happy to see you here! üôÇ </strong> √Ångel.

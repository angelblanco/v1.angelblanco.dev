# What I've done through the years?

#### 2012-2016 (University)

- Gradute at ["Universidad de Salamanca"](https://usal.es) with a grade point average of `8.7` / `10`. My end-of-degree project was an iOS application connected to a Laravel API. It used Larvel, jQuery and Bootstrap on the administrator's web.
- I completed an internship at [a research group (Bisite)](https://bisite.usal.es/) as an iOS software developer.

#### 2017-2018

- I completed a [Master's degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.usal.es/master-ingenieria-informatica). I did my final project with Laravel and Vue.

- I've joined [Beonprice](https://beonprice.com/product) at the beginning of my Master's degree and started my 3-month internship. After a successful relationship, I started working as a Junior developer. I started my career doing [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) with `PHP`, `Symfony` and `Laravel`, including:
  - Web crawling.
  - Third-party integrations. Most of them with other hospitality partners via Rest APIS, SFTP, SMTP, etc.

#### 2018-present

At this time, I joined the solutions team and started working as a full-stack developer. Then in 2019, I was promoted to software architect, and since 2020, I'm currently working as a Teach Lead in charge of other teammates.

- I lead all kinds of projects inside the company, including Data visualization, dashboarding, reporting, business intelligence, real-time hotel price publication, configuration, email notifications, etc.
- I work side to side with the product team refining the requirements and reducing the gap between the team and the business.
- My role also includes helping new teammates to achieve their goals by reviewing their code and mentoring them.
- Develop and maintain all the company microservices and web views.
- I deal with high load APIS, query optimization, monitoring, authentication, caching, high availability, or multi-tenancy.
- I lead tech professionalization in the company, including:
  - Implement the introduction Vue, tailwind, and Webpack. We deprecated jQuery.
  - Desing and migration to Kubernetes.
  - Suggest the creation of shared and well-tested [Laravel packages](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/packages). Shared packages reduced code duplication across the entire organization.
  - Implementation of CI/CD. Added testing into the existing codebase. We use `Laravel`, `PHPUnit`, `Playwright`, `Cypress`, and `Mocha`.
  - Upgrade legacy projects to the latest versions of `Laravel`, `NodeJS`, and `Webpack`.
  - I added quality assurance tools like [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Airbnb Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) or [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer). They have successfully reduced technical debt.

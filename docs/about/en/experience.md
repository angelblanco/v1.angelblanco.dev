# What I've done through the years?

#### 2012-2016 (University)

- Gradute at ["Universidad de Salamanca"](https://usal.es) with a grade point average of `8.7` / `10`. My end-of-degree project was an iOS application that interacted with a Laravel backend that could be managed with a Laravel back office. It used `jQuery` and `Bootstrap` on the front end.
- I completed an internship at [a research group (Bisite)](https://bisite.usal.es/) as an iOS software developer.

#### 2017-2018

- I completed a [Master's degree in Computer Engeniering](https://www.usal.es/master-ingenieria-informatica). The end-of-master project was built with Laravel and Vue.

- I've joined [Beonprice](https://beonprice.com/product) at the beginning of my Master's degree and started my 3-month internship. After a successful relationship, I was hired as a Junior developer. I started my career doing [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) with `php`, `symfony` and `laravel` which includes:
  - Web crawling.
  - Third-party integrations with other hospitality partners via Rest APIS, SFTP, SMTP, etc.

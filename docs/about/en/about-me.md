## About me

I am a software engineer working remotely from Salamanca, Spain. I love to work on web technologies and software architectures. I usally go full stack and latetly I've been enjoying a lot working with tailwind and vue.

I am comfortable working with: `Vue Js`, `Svelte`, `Tailwind`, `PHP`, `Laravel`, `Mongo DB`, `SQL`, `Redis`, `RabbitMQ`, `SCSS`, `Bem`, `Docker`, `jQUery`, `Node JS`, and `Webpack`.

I enjoy **test driven development**. I have experience with both unit and e2e testing. In this area the libraries include: `Phpunit`, `Mockery`, `Cypres`, `Mocha`.

In the past, I've also worked with `Swift` as an `iOS` developer.

> I work at [Beonprice](https://beonprice.com/product) as a software architect an Teach Lead since February 2017.
> I mix the role of publishing new features to the web application with Vue JS and Laravel with the design of high availability microservices with Kubernetes.

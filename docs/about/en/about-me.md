# About me

I am Ángel :angel:, a software engineer working remotely from Spain. I love to work with web technologies.

My tech stack usually includes [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I'm proud to say I've been using Laravel since version `5.2` back in 2015 and Vue since version `2.2` at 2017.

I enjoy **test driven development**, having experience with both unit and end to end testing.

> As any other developer working on a startup, I've done a lot of
> things throught the years!

Since 2020, I'm the **tech leader** of one the teams at my company.
We ship our features with a fully continuos integrated pipeline.
I have designed and implemented a lot of a lot of views and their associated
backend microservices deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Handling TBs of data has lead me me to learn about [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## About me

I am a software engineer based in Salamanca, Spain. 
I love to work on web technologies and software architectures, especially on the backend side of life.

I am comfortable working with: `PHP`, `Laravel`, `Vue Js`, `Mongo DB`, `SQL`, `Redis`, `Docker`, `Node JS`, and `Webpack`. 
In the past, I've also worked with `Swift` as an `iOS` developer.

> I work at [Beonprice](https://beonprice.com/product) as a software architect since February 2017. 
> I mix the role of publishing new features to the web application with Vue JS and Laravel with the design of high availability microservices with Kubernetes.

One of my main hobbies aside computers is playing rock & blues :guitar:.

# About me :point_up:

I am Ángel Blanco :angel:, a software engineer working remotely from Spain. I love to work with web technologies.

My tech stack usually includes [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I'm proud to say I've been using Laravel since version `5.2`, back in 2015, and Vue since version `2.2`, in 2017.

I enjoy **test-driven development**. My professional experience includes unit and end-to-end testing.

> Right now, you can find me at [Beonprice](https://beonprice.com/en/product) since February 2017.
> As any other developer working on a startup, I've done a great variety of
> things since then!

In 2020 I was promoted to **tech leader** of one of the teams at my company.
We ship our features with a completely continuous integrated pipeline.
I have designed and implemented a lot of views and their associated
backend microservices deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Handling TBs of data has led me to expand my skills with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

In the past, I've also briefly worked with `Swift` as an `iOS` developer. Finally, you can find a brief resume of some other libraries that I know here:

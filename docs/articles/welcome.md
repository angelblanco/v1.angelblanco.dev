description: It's finally up! Checkout my open source blog built from scratch. 
intro: |
    For the past few months, I've been working on building a tech blog using
    [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) from scratch!

    I'm planing to make some articles about **Laravel**, **PHP**, **Javascript**, **Docker**, **microservices**, etc. 

    During the COVID 19  lockdown, I had more time to finish the implementation and now it can be put into production. I've great inspiration from [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) but decided to do all the job with Svelte to try it out.
    
    I've open-sourced the code of my sapper project containing this own site on Github just in case you want to inspect it. You can learn a lit bit more about me [here](/about).
    
    During the start of this adventure, I will be posting some of the solutions to the "challenges" I've faced during the development.

    Hope to see you soon.

    √Ångel Blanco.
